            I was recently reading the comment section of a post discussing how a particular
             fictional hypercarnivorous tribe with human anatomy would avoid scurvy, 
             and there was one comment that said "Just eat the livers", 
             followed by a reply chain from what I presume was a non-native English speaker 
             that was quite confused that anyone would think it was advisable to survive on nothing 
             but liver. I wasn't sure what was going on for a second and then it clicked 
             that they had read "Just eat the livers" as "Just eat the livers". 
             This got me wondering if there is a term for this phenomenon,
             and if it's more common in some languages than others.
